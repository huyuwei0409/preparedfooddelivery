We will focus on online prepared food delivery which includes restaurant websites, food ordering platforms, and delivery apps in China and the U.S. First, we will compare the online prepared food delivery between China and the U.S., including but not limited to the market size, providerâ€™s market share, active users, and usage rate. After knowing the quantitative number and trends, we will identify the reasons for the changes in each country and reasons for the gap between the two countries, from the economic perspective.
