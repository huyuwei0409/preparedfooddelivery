Online food delivery, in comparison to traditional restaurants, is a relatively new option for people nowadays, particularly during epidemics. Food delivery is already a significant and developed market in China, with numerous mature studies available on the internet. However, there is a dearth of reporting and statistics in the United States. We launched this research to better understand the present food delivery market in the United States and the variables that contribute to its growth.We are going to present our analysis in three parts: Food delivery market overview and growth Factors that affect the degree of development from a demand perspective Factors that affect the degree of development from a supply perspective "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Describe the data sources 2.2 Basic information about the food delivery datasets 2.3 Basic information about the supply for food delivery datasets 2.4 Basic information about the demand for food delivery datasets 2.5 Describe any issues with the data", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Describe the data sources The goal of our project is to analyze the food delivery market, which includes but is not limited to the restaurant and foodservice industry and online food delivery over the U.S. To understand the scale and growth of the food delivery market, we collected data from NPD Group: National Purchase Diary Panel (https://www.npd.com), which measures how consumers shop across channels and quantitive sales, share, distribution, and velocity, and Statista(https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-food-delivery/united-states), a business data platform across different industries and countries. These datasets are easily accessible through either custom search or well-organized industry segment. We obtained the data sets of the restaurant food delivery growth, the share of delivery sales in the foodservice market, and revenue/average revenue per User/penetration rate of different types of food delivery market. One perspective of our analysis is from the main macroeconomic aim of the supply side of food delivery. The data we collected included population which is divided by unemployment, smartphone ownership and education level (over 25). The data was obtained from the United States Census Bureau(https://www.census.gov/topics.html) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics(https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag722.html). From the microeconomic aim of the supply side, we collected the data on the average hourly earnings of food service, the number of private restaurants number, the monthly employment of all restaurants, and quick-service restaurants which we believe will have a higher percentage of food delivery service. We are also interested in the demand side of food delivery and the underlying connection between them. Part of the data in this section was collected from the United States Department of Agriculture(https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-expenditure-series/) and Pew Research Center(https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/). We believe the impact of change in food expenditure and CPI change for food should be deducted from the growth of food delivery, otherwise, the food delivery market will be overvalued. We also think the change in working hours is correlated with the tendency of ordering the food delivery. 2.2 Basic information about the food delivery datasets food delivery 2019-2020.xlsx 1: Countries all: Growth of food delivery from 2019 to 2020 by all channel order digital: Growth of food delivery from 2019 to 2020 by digital order online food delivery 2017-2021.csv Market eServices Online Food Delivery Platform-to-Consumer Delivery Restaurant-to-Consumer Delivery Chart Average Revenue per User Average Revenue per User by Segment Penetration Rate Penetration Rate by Segment Revenue Revenue Change Usage Shares Users Users by Age Users by Gender Users by Income Users by Segment share of delivery in food service 2013-2022.xlsx share: Proportion of food service sales in the United States which are made via delivery from 2013 to 2022 2.3 Basic information about the supply for food delivery datasets unemployment 2010-2022.csv Series ID: Table name Year: Year(2010-2022) Period: Month(M + number) Label: Year(xxxx) + Month(xxx) Value: Unemployment in percentage w/o % education by 2020.xlsx row: Detailed years of school Elementary or High school, no diploma Elementary or High school, GED * College, no degree Associates degree, vocational Associates degree, academic Bachelors degree1 Graduate school, no masters degree1 Masters degree programs1 * Professional or Doctorate degree col: Year(2000-2021) private restaurant number.xlsx Year: 2010-2021 Qtr1: The number of private restaurant in the 1st quarter Qtr2: The number of private restaurant in the 2nd quarter Qtr3: The number of private restaurant in the 3rd quarter Qtr4: The number of private restaurant in the 4th quarter Annual: The number of private restaurant in whole year annual restaurant worker earning.xlsx Year: 2010-2021 Annual: AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS OF ALL EMPLOYEES 2.4 Basic information about the demand for food delivery datasets food_expenditures_source_funds.csv FAH expenditures million nominal dollars by households FAH expenditures million nominal dollars by home production FAH expenditures million nominal dollars by government FAFH expenditures million nominal dollars by households FAFH expenditures million nominal dollars by home production FAFH expenditures million nominal dollars by government Note: FAH means Food at Home, FAFH means Food Away From Home It also includes the price adjusted value of food expenditure cpi change for food.xlsx Year: 2012-2022 columns: Jan-Dec, HALF1, HALF2 cpi change for all.xlsx Year: 2010-2022 columns: Jan-Dec, Annual, HALF1, HALF2 working_hour_weekly.csv Series ID: Table name Year: Year(2010-2022) Period: Month(M + number) Label: Year(xxxx) + Month(xxx) Value: Working hours in week smartphone.xlsx Month(xxx)+Year(xx) proportion of smartphone ownership 2.5 Describe any issues with the data Our initial idea is to create a choropleth map of percentage change of market revenue or share over time in the U.S. The data about food delivery, however, is not sufficient since it is a new service. The year range of datasets is not consistent. The datasets collected from the government website tend to have a wider time range, we have to adjust our time range to make them on the same scale.

For food delivery data, we removed unrelated columns and selected rows based on multiple factor levels - Online Food Delivery for Market, and Revenue and Users by Segment for Chart. We create a new vector called YEAR, from the information stored in the specifying columns from 3 to 7.

"],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Food delivery outlook 5.2 Demand for food delivery analysis 5.3 Supply for food delivery analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Food delivery outlook Lets start with some fundamental data on food delivery, including market share, growth rates for both traditional and online food delivery, industry revenue, and the number of users. We can observe from this line chart that the market share of food delivery has been continuously increasing at a pace of about 0.35 percent per year. Its worth mentioning that the data source for 2020-2022 is a forecast based on prior years trends, therefore it displays the same steady rise as the previous year. In reality, due of the pandemic, there may be some significant changes in food delivery share in the food delivery industry. Well look at the overall growth rate of the different countries as well as online food delivery when it comes to how to order food delivery. We do this by plotting the rate of change on the x-axis and the country on the y-axis, with distinct colored points representing all food delivery and online food delivery. According to the graph above, between 2009 and 2020, the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan, and Brazil have the highest growth rates in both all food delivery and online food delivery. The growth rate of online food delivery was higher than the growth rate of all food delivery in each of these nations; in fact, more than half of the countries had a substantially higher growth rate of online food delivery. Weve divided the revenue from meal delivery into two categories. The first is Platform to Consumer Delivery, which focuses on online delivery services that serve customers with meals from partner restaurants that arent required to conduct food delivery. Restaurant to Consumer Delivery is the second option, which is a more traditional method of ordering food delivery. The ratio of platform delivery to restaurant delivery is increasing year after year, as shown in the first graph. Restaurant delivery income is roughly 1.5 times that of platform delivery in 2017, and by 2021, restaurant and platform delivery revenue becomes virtually equal. Overall, both companies revenue is expanding year after year. The number and ratio of users are trending in the same direction as market revenue. Revenue and user numbers both climbed moderately from 2017 to 2019, before climbing dramatically from 2020 to 2021. 5.2 Demand for food delivery analysis In this section, we look at the causes behind the shift in the food delivery market from the demand side. We look into whether the four aspects, such as smartphone usage, working hours, CPI, and food expenditure, can explain the reasons for the changes in the food delivery business. 5.2.1 Smartphone ownership analysis We first expected that smartphone ownership would be associated to online ordering, notably in terms of platform to customer delivery and number of users. Because more individuals are utilizing smartphones, the likelihood of using an ordering APP will increase. We can observe from this graph that the use of smartphones increased the most rapidly from 2011 to 2016, and that this is due to technological advancements. Because the data in the preceding section is limited for the years 2017 to 2021, we will also concentrate on these years in this section. We can observe that there was no growth from 2017 to 2018, which corresponds to what we saw in the previous section. In the years that followed, smartphone ownership rose slowly, but that was also due to the fact that smartphone ownership was near saturation. 5.2.2 Working hour analysis We assumed in this section that when working hours increased, the market share and users of food delivery would increase as well, because the amount of time people spend preparing their own food and dining in would decrease. Overall, between 2012 and 2019, the populations working hour did not change much, although it ebbed and flowed, hovering around 34.5 hours per week. Hours worked dipped substantially during the Covid-19 in 2020 before fast rising, and have risen and fallen dramatically since then, but are still higher generally than before. When compared to our prior market analysis, these large shifts in work hours do not appear to have had an impact on our market, since the long-term trend in work hours is still increasing, which supports our theory that longer work hours will lead to an increase in food delivery users and the market revenue. 5.2.3 CPI analysis Our CPI(Consumer Price Index) analysis, unlike the prior demand analysis, is based on the assumption that inflation will overstate market growth. In its most basic form, CPI implies that we determine the amount and kind of commodities at the onset, and that this aspect does not vary over time; only the price of goods fluctuates. This concept suggests that if the CPI is too high, inflation is rising, and the food delivery market, which may have been growing swiftly at first, is now being overvalued as the price index rises. What we need to do is to remove the impact of CPI from the market in our analysis. Of course, CPI has no bearing on market share, it only affects the nominal value. In this time series graph, we depict the overall CPI and the food CPI separately. The graph shows that the change in CPI is fairly similar to the previous figure, ranging about 0 from 2012 to 2020, with some sporadic large changes. Furthermore, both food and total CPI changes are in one direction and follow the same pattern. And the changes after 2020 are extremely dramatic. First, the food CPI changes by 1.5 in 2020, implying that our earlier food market revenue estimates may be significantly overstated, although we cant quantify this overestimation here due to the complexities of calculations. After that, the overall food CPI increased in long term trend. We could infer from price index analysis that the food delivery markets revenue and growth are not as high as they appear. One of the primary reasons is that food prices have risen, resulting in an increase in the food delivery markets revenue, which may not be as significant if the quantity of food sold is the only factor. This may also be observed in the number of users, as the rise in revenue of the food delivery market is more substantial than the number of users. 5.2.4 Food expenditure analysis We first assumed that as the market share of food delivery grew, so would household food consumption away from home. However, from 2010 to 2020, the ratio of food consumed at home to food expenditure away from home stayed at 1. Only during the 2020 outbreak did the percentage of food expenditure spent at home rise slightly, but not significantly. 5.3 Supply for food delivery analysis In this section, we examine the relation between key supply-side issues and the food delivery market. These factors include working earning, the number of restaurants, the unemployment rate, and educational level. We originally expected that when working earning rises, the percentage of people who spend money on food delivery will rise as well, because food delivery will be more expensive than other options. And, as previously said, a rise in the number of restaurants would result in an increase in the percentage of the food delivery market, because one of the methods of food delivery is restaurant-to-customer. In addition, the unemployment rate should be inversely proportional to the food delivery market share. Working earnings and the number of restaurants are positively correlated with the food delivery market, as shown by the correlogram and heatmap, and the correlation coefficient is strong, near to one, indicating a perfect positive association. Food delivery market share grows as the number of restaurants and working incomes grows, and vice versa. On the other hand, the average unemployment rate is negatively correlated to the food delivery market share. The market share of each year is quite well distributed for the most part, but there is one outlier, which is the year 2020. The year 2019 features high working-earnings and restaurant-number values. Because there is no high education threshold for delivery, we initially assumed that the delivery staffs education level would be low. As a result, when the general number of people without high education level is large, the supply side of delivery will increase. However, we can see from this graph overall education level is improving year after year, indicating that there is no specific relationship between the two. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Trend of food delivery revenue by channels Platform Restaurant The interactive bar chart above depicts the revenue generated by various food delivery channels. It depicts the upward trend in revenue for both the platform and the restaurant. Because we use the same scale, you can look at the revenue trend over the last year and get a sense of the entire volume. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Main takeaways 7.2 Limitation 7.3 Future directions 7.4 Lessons learned", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Main takeaways Based on our analysis of the food delivery market, we have the following finds: We observed that the increase in market share was approximately equivalent, however the increase in revenue has altered dramatically in recent years. This shift can be explained by an increase in time worked and earnings, as well as an increase in the number of restaurants. Surprisingly, the number of users has not increased at the same rate as revenue, and we assume this is due to inflation. This disparity is clearly explained by our CPI analysis, which is the nominal value is overestimated by the inflation. 7.2 Limitation Because this is still a small business, most relevant data is collected in years rather than months, so you wont be able to monitor cyclical changes, only long-term patterns. Because our data is collected through multiple websites, this time interval is not consistent, and we can only analyze using the same time interval, which may result in bias in our analysis results. 7.3 Future directions Future analysis of the food delivery market can be based on microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives. In this section, the data is more valid and accurate. We may use region-based heatmaps to track changes in the food delivery market in cities at various stages of growth. We can also examine residents lifestyles by looking at changes in consumer expenditure. Given the scarcity of data on the food delivery industry, we may also assess the overall market by focusing on the revenue of the top players in delivery apps. 7.4 Lessons learned We learned throughout this project that collecting and processing real-world data is significantly more difficult than what we studied in class. We spent a lot of time collecting and processing data, and as we were doing so, we were also forming hypotheses about our research, because we needed to assume the variables that could be obtained before we could gather the relevant data. And, when it came to chart design, we created and eliminated a lot of them until we found the one that best represented our data.
